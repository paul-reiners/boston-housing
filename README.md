## Predicting Boston Housing Prices
### Model Evaluation &amp; Validation Project

You want to be the best real estate agent out there. In order to compete with other agents in your area, you decide to use machine learning. You are going to use various statistical analysis tools to build the best model to predict the value of a given house. Your task is to find the best price your client can sell their house at. The best guess from a model is one that best generalizes the data.

Your client has a house with the following feature set: [11.95, 0.00, 18.100, 0, 0.6590, 5.6090, 90.00, 1.385, 24, 680.0, 20.20, 332.09, 12.13].
